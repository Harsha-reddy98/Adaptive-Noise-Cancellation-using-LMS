# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation-using-LMS

Objective of this project is to filter out the additive noise in a noisy signal i.e. noise reduction by means of
adaptive filtering techniques. LMS (least mean square error) based noise cancellation technique can be used on input 
noisy signal to obtain the de-noised signal as the output. We will combine audio sample of speech (original signal) with
real noise to generate noisy signal with a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using MATLAB.
